Got the weather information from the "Open Weather Map" API.. 
Used Twilio API to send text message for rain alert using requests lib in python. Upload the code in the "Python Anywhere"(find it in google) schedule the code frequency,
time, expiry so the code will run automatically on the scheduled time and if it going to rain soon in your region you will get a rain alert!! ITS quite useful project to get a reminder :
"Dont forget to carry umbrella, Its going to rain"
